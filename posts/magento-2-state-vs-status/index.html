Capitalized nouns indicate Magento concepts. <code>fixed width font</code> indicates a fixed technical term.</p><h2 id=there-is-state>There is State:</h2><p>Orders have States. State denotes what technically currently is happening to the order (eg. <code>processing</code> meaning an Order is being prepared but isn&rsquo;t complete yet). There actually is a fairly simple default state machine for Order States: <code>new</code> -> <code>processing</code> -> <code>complete</code>. Those are the mandatory States. The others are there for eventualities, like waiting for async payment, or for fully refunded Orders. The States are fixed, you can&rsquo;t add new arbitrary ones. They trigger certain events within Magento as well, like Invoice creation. States can have a label, but that is typically only visible in the backend.</p><h2 id=then-there-is-status-which-the-provider-of-the-answer-spells-states>Then there is Status (which the provider of the answer spells &ldquo;states&rdquo;):</h2><p>A Status builds on top of the core concept of Order State, and is intended to give more information to consumers or store owners about what&rsquo;s happening to an Order, beyond the scope of the limited Order State Machine. It&rsquo;s merely a label and has no bearing on the core business processes happening to an order (e.g. you cannot generate an Invoice from an Order hitting a certain Status alone, you&rsquo;d need to transition it to a State in order to trigger that. You can set Order Status conditionally, e.g. only for Orders with a selected Payment Method. Let&rsquo;s consider two examples:</p><ol><li>Order with Credit Card: The Order is created (State <code>new</code>), we confirm the Payment, and State now is <code>processing</code>. A potential Status here could be &ldquo;Payment received&rdquo;. The Order would get shipped and State would turn to <code>completed</code>.</li><li>Order on invoice (not BNPL, let&rsquo;s assume classic invoice payment): The Order is created (State <code>new</code>), but no payment has been made yet. Order State progresses directly to <code>processing</code>, but Status here would rather be something like &ldquo;Order has been shipped&rdquo;. We could even read out the package delivery API and set Status to &ldquo;Order delivered at dd-mm-yyyy, awaiting invoice payment&rdquo;, while the Order State remains in <code>processing</code>. Only when the invoice payment is received, we set State to completed.</li></ol><p>Hope the examples illustrate why you need Status while maintaining the same State Machine.</p><h2 id=further-reading>Further reading</h2><ul><li><a href=https://magecomp.com/blog/difference-magento-order-status-order-state-magento-2/>https://magecomp.com/blog/difference-magento-order-status-order-state-magento-2/</a></li><li><a href=https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/stores-sales/order-management/orders/order-status.html>https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/stores-sales/order-management/orders/order-status.html</a></li></ul><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://idaikt.sporkify.net/>&copy; I drink and I know things 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
