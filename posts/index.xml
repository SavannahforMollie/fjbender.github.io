We will not return the IBAN on API level (as e.g. RatePay does), as Klarna does not follow this type of white label approach. They want to position their brand directly towards the consumer.

In order to have this explained to you, you have to provide a valid PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance.
This endpoint is, unfortunately, not suitable for card tokenization from an App context, as the Access-Control-Allow-Origin HTTP Header prevents this (I think, I don&amp;rsquo;t really do frontend). See the Further Reading sections for In-App alternatives.</description></item><item><title>Webhook 401 Htaccess</title><link>https://idaikt.sporkify.net/webhook-401-htaccess/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2022 11:11:45 +0100</pubDate><author>Florian Bender</author><guid>https://idaikt.sporkify.net/webhook-401-htaccess/</guid><description>Webhook calls fail with 401 Unauthorized The merchant probably is using a .htaccess file to restrict access to their stage environment. In order for our webhooks to get delivered, the merchant needs to add our IP addresses to the allow-list.
How to add IP addresses to the allow list See here.

It&rsquo;s actually funny, if it wasn&rsquo;t so sad. And also the slight dyslexia (and/or lack of command of the Latin language) of the person who wrote the response doesn&rsquo;t help either.
Let&rsquo;s think this through. Capitalized nouns indicate Magento concepts. fixed width font indicates a fixed technical term.
